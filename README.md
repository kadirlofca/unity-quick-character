# Hello Respawn! 
This is a project I've been working on to produce character movement like the ones in Apex Legends and Titanfall. 

# Contents
Inside the zipped folder, you will find an executable game and some C# scripts.
You can play the game, which consists of just a character that you can control. The character can crouch (ctrl) and wall run.
The code behind character movement is also included in the zipped folder.

Thank you!
