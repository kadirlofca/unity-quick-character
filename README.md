# Hello! 
This is a project I've been working on to easily produce fluid character movement like the ones in Titanfall and Overwatch.

# Contents
Inside ExecutableGame, you can run the game. The game consists of a character that you can control and some geometry in the scene. The character can crouch (ctrl) and wall run.

The code behind the project is inside qc-project. The code that involves the character is inside QuickCharacter.cs and AdvancedCharacter.cs.

# Note
This was intended to be a commercial project, but I decided to make it public to showcase in my job applications. So, you will not find this project in my portfolio.
